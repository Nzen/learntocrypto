Ah, using a single main works. And responding on a separate thread makes this actually work.

I had links to fastjson wiki pages, but that's fine, I can get them again.

problem 02 involves the teller able to deposit to the bank. The bank will provide a sum of the deposits, preferably by using a lambda and reduce() on the list of received messages.

I'm inclined to add a protocol compatibiityId, but that should be low on the list of things I can change.

Added jar maven config, but I left it broken because I need a switch such that it will run either the server or client. Preferably, it should use a cli arg to choose which (I wonder if a teller is different from a bank user). Also add one for the tcp port.
